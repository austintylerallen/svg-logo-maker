# SVG Logo Maker

## Description
This Node.js application in the command-line allows users to generate simple logos for their projects. Users can input text, choose text color, select a shape (circle, triangle, or square), and choose the shape's color. The application then makes an SVG file named `logo.svg` based on the user's input.
